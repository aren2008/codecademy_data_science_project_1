# Codecademy Data Science Project 1

#### This first project analyzed the relation between health insurance costs and a few variables such as gender, number of children, age, BMI, whether you smoke or not, and region you live in. The data suggests that males pay more for health care than females. Number of children did not affect health care rates significantly. As you grow older, health care costs go linearly up. Being obese and smoking both dramatically increase your health care costs. Region has small to no impact on costs.
